# Point72MinimalApi
# Test task for the Print 72 company. 
To add motivation to complete this task, I decided to use a clean architecture and a new approach in creating api applications with minimal ari. 
I included standard clean architecture approaches like CQRS, TDD and so on. Added auth but did not create a full user signin, as this was not included in the test task. 
To work with the api, you will need to run the application and add the swagger subdirectory to the url
