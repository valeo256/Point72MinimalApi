# Point72MinimalApi
# Test task for the Print 72 company.

To add motivation to complete this task, I decided to use a clean architecture and a new approach in creating api applications with minimal ari. 

I included standard clean architecture approaches like CQRS, DDD and so on. Added auth but did not create a full user signin, as this was not included in the test task. 

To work with the api, you will need to: 
1. Run sql scripts from a src\Infrastructure\Persistence\Seed catalog
2. Run the application and add the swagger subdirectory to the url (https://localhost:7110/swagger/index.html)
3. Choose the endpoint on a dashboard and "Try it out"

You should use .net 7 and Visual Studion 2022 or alternative.
